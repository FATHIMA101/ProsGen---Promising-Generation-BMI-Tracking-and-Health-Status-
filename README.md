This is a Flutter-based mobile app that allows students to track their BMI (Body Mass Index) data and receive doctor recommendations based on their health status. The app fetches real-time BMI data from a backend API and presents it in an intuitive list view. Users with abnormal BMI levels can navigate to a list of available doctors

This application enables seamless collaboration among healthcare professionals and educational stakeholders to track, manage, and enhance student wellness. It connects:

-Students to their health data

-Doctors for diagnosis and suggestions

-Teachers & Physical Education Teachers for behavior tracking and physical activity

-Parents for real-time health updates and communication
